# Swift Boilerplate

Save time creating Swift apps with file and project templates.

## Quick Overview

```
git clone https://github.com/nikolasgioannou/swift-boilerplate.git
cd swift-boilerplate
cp -R Templates ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/
```

To use a template, create a new Xcode project and select a template from the Swift Boilerplate section. For file templates, press `command + n` and follow the same process.

## Templates

### Programmatic App

A template for those who don't use `main.storyboard`, setting up your Xcode project based on this [tutorial](https://sarunw.com/posts/how-to-create-new-xcode-project-without-storyboard/#xcode-11).

## Contribution

I'll be working on Swift Boilerplate in my free time. If you have file or project templates to share or find an issue with an existing template, feel free to make a pull request.
